Developing a game where we have to link puyos of the same color to increase your score. Possible key actions and details mentioned below.

PLAYERS - 

This is a basic PuyoGame where your objective is to connect puyos of the same color to score points (4 or more in a row). You can control the game using the following keys:

Left arrow: Shift puyos to the left
Right arrow: Shift puyos to the right
A: Rotate puyos counterclockwise
D: Rotate puyos clockwise
Space bar: Drop the active puyos
M: Toggle sound mute
Escape: Pause the game
The goal is to strategically connect puyos of the same color to create chains and score points. Use the controls wisely to achieve higher scores and advance in the game


DEVELOPERS - 

This project is developed using Maven and follows a modular design philosophy, aiming for maximum flexibility and ease of updates. All classes and methods are thoroughly documented using JavaDoc. The game utilizes Swing Lib for graphics rendering, but its architecture is designed to seamlessly integrate with a 2D game engine if desired, thanks to its modular structure (refer to the UML class diagram).

Each key aspect of the game, including logic, display, and inputs, is separated into distinct modules, adhering to the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. This modular approach enhances the game's adaptability and makes it highly extensible. If optimization were the focus, certain modules could be consolidated and simpler data structures utilized.

All visual assets, including images and sounds, are custom-made, ensuring a unique and cohesive aesthetic throughout the game. With comprehensive documentation and a modular design, this project offers a solid foundation for further enhancements and customization.
